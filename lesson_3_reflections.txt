When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with others, or when want to present my project to others for further usage, response, etc

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

not at every step is needed to present the repository or not at any stage of my local work I want to being synced with a possible change at the remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks exist only on github, they are clones but registered and are available only on github.
clones are exact copies of repos either on github or on different local computers
brnches are new versions of a repo for the sake of new feature or different mode or debug
