How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By searching thorugh only those lines which was changed/modified between the two versions.
So it wwasn't necessary to search through all the two files from their beginning to their end.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

For debugging purposes if it pops out later in time. For archiving different releases.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: time is not necessarily a good breaking point but after steps which relates to each other logically. Con: If someone forgets to commit than autosave could be better

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for programming specifically while GDocs was designed for whatever file creating and storing, not project works.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log is for searching all the changes. 
dif is for comparing two changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Since I know it can be debugged by finding its version it gives confidence

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
